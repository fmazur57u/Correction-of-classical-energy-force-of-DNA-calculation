# Correction-of-classical-energy-force-of-DNA-calculation
Code that give a correction of classical energy and force of DNA. This code cut the DNA by three part and each part is cut by dyads. For each dyads, the code delete some atom for have the same number of atom. Each coodinates of atom dyads are add in a matrix (not at the same time) containing already coordinates of 285 dyads. After, the code create a PCA space with the matrix and take projection in e0 and e1 (two first principal component) of coordinates of studied dyads (it's always the first line of the matrix). With one spline, the code find the correction of energy of each dyads and the gradient of spline is force correction. The code calculate the sum of correction energy and force of each dyads for the three part of DNA molecules. Finally, the correction of each part is divided by two and the final correction is the sum of correction of each part.
